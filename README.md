# US-Debt-Tracker-Project

**The project focuses on analyzing the US public and governmental debt.**

|Data Dictionary|Definition|
|----------|----------|
|Debt Held by the Public|This is the portion of the US public debt that is held by individuals, corporations, foreign governments, and other entities outside of the US government.|
|Intragovernmental Holdings|This is the portion of the US public debt that is held by other US government agencies.|
|Total Public Debt Outstanding|This is the sum of the debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings.|

## Data Sources

US Debt Tracker: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "DebtPenny_19930401_20240509" file, containing detailed information about debts held by the public and intragovernmental holdings. You can access the data from [fiscaldata.treasury](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny)

## Tools

Excel

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. Downloading Data and inspection.
2. Handling missing values and blanks.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.
  - Converted Scientic notation amounts to number.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the US Debt Tracker data to answer key questions, such as:

- What was the Yearly Debt Percentage Increase for each year compared to the previous year?
- Which months historically have seen the highest/lowest increases in Total debt?
- What is the projected growth of the publicly held debt in the next few years?

##                                                           Outcomes:

There is a huge spike increase in the Debt Held by the Public in the years of 2008 and 2020. The spike in the yearly increase percentage of Debt Held by the Public in the years 2008 and 2020 can be attributed to significant economic events that occurred during those years:
    2008 Financial Crisis: In 2008, the global financial system experienced one of the most severe financial crises in history, commonly known as the Great Recession. The crisis was triggered by a combination of factors, including the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, excessive risk-taking by financial institutions, and a lack of regulatory oversight. As a result, governments worldwide implemented massive stimulus measures to stabilize financial markets, support failing institutions, and stimulate economic growth. These stimulus packages often involved significant government spending, leading to a sharp increase in public debt levels.

   COVID-19 Pandemic: In 2020, the world faced another unprecedented crisis with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. To contain the spread of the virus and mitigate its economic impact, governments implemented strict lockdown measures, resulting in widespread business closures, job losses, and economic contraction. To support individuals, businesses, and healthcare systems during the pandemic, governments enacted massive fiscal stimulus measures, including direct payments, unemployment benefits, loans, grants, and subsidies. These emergency spending measures, combined with a sharp decline in tax revenues due to reduced economic activity, led to a significant increase in public debt levels globally.


##                                                           Suggestions:

In both cases, the extraordinary circumstances necessitated substantial government intervention to stabilize financial markets, support economic recovery, and provide relief to affected individuals and businesses. These interventions often involved increased government borrowing, leading to higher levels of public debt. The spike in Debt Held by the Public yearly increase percentage in 2008 and 2020 reflects the unprecedented scale of government spending and borrowing during these crises.

## Outcomes:

A spike in Debt Held by the Public outstanding in the United States from September until December can be influenced by several factors, including government spending patterns, tax revenues, economic conditions, and specific events or policies. Here are some potential reasons for such a spike:
Government Spending Increases: Towards the end of the fiscal year, government agencies may accelerate spending to utilize remaining budget allocations. This increased spending can contribute to a higher level of public debt outstanding.
Economic Stimulus Measures: If the government implements economic stimulus measures or relief packages during this period, such as during times of economic downturn or crisis, it may borrow additional funds to finance these initiatives. This can result in a spike in public debt outstanding.
Economic Conditions: Changes in economic conditions, such as fluctuations in interest rates or GDP growth, can impact government borrowing and spending decisions. During periods of economic uncertainty or recession, governments may increase borrowing to finance stimulus measures or counteract declining revenues, leading to higher levels of public debt outstanding.
One-time Expenditures: Certain one-time expenditures or events, such as people going on holidays, disaster relief efforts, infrastructure projects, or large-scale government contracts, may require additional borrowing and contribute to a spike in public debt outstanding during this period.

## Suggetions:

Stragetic planning is needed to avoid huge spike in Debt Held by the Public outstanding.

## Outcomes:

There is a steady increase in the projected Debt Held by the Public. It's challenging to provide specific projections for the growth of publicly held debt in the next few years without knowing the precise policy decisions, economic conditions, and other factors that will shape future fiscal outcomes. However, analysts, economists, and government agencies often provide projections and scenarios to help policymakers and the public understand potential future trends in debt levels. These projections are typically subject to uncertainty and can change based on evolving economic and policy developments. 


# Conclusion

I have attached the Summarized data (Excel Sheet) with the final product where you will be able to access the process used to arrive to the above results. You will find the data useful as it also shows the type of Pivot Table used.
